# RISC-V CPU
RISC-V CPU design with a 5 stage pipeline, data forwarding, hazard detection and branch prediction. This project was done to improve my understanding of the RISC-V architecture and general computer architecture principles. 

Current Design of the CPU:

Roadmap (Things I will be implementing next): 
1. Exeception/Interrupt Handling (Ecall, Ebreak, Sret.wfi)
2. Multiplication/Division Extension (RV32M)
3. Floating Point Extension (RV32F)
4. Atomic Extension (RV32A)
5. Virtual Memory Compatibility and other associated memory stuff (Fence.i, Fence, Sfence.vma)
6. Upgrade the design to the priveledged implementation and include CSR instructions (Csrrw, Csrrs, Csrrc, Csrrwi, Csrrsi, Csrrci)
