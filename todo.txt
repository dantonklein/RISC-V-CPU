1. or gate on the PCSrc Line to account for branches and jumps
2. Mux on the line feeding the PC counter for accounting for jumps
3. Mux to bypass ALU for storing addresses to rd for JAL and JALR
4. two new control lines for jumps, one for rd mux and one for JALR
5. test updated immgen/sign extend
6. move branch hardware to ID stage this involves moving the address adder and jump stuff to the id stage.
need to add mux to change source of adder for address for jumps.
7. test hazard detection and branch prediction hardware.
