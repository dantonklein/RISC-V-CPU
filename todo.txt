test data forwarding
writing to a register that gets read from the next cycle
writing to a register that gets read from 2 cycles

test these hazards
Hazard 1: load instruction saving to a register used by a branch the next cycle
Hazard 2: load instruction saving to a register used by a jump the next cycle
Hazard 3: instruction tries to read a register following a load instruction that writes the same register
Hazard 4: alu instruction in EX immediately preceding a branch produces an operand for the branch
Hazard 5: alu instruction in EX immediately preceding a jump produces an operand for the jump

test branch prediction
