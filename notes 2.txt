Notes in Gville

There are 32 registers and 2^30 memory words
Risc V is byte addressed, each word is separated by 4

Arithmetic.
add a, b, c : adds b and c and stores in a

Each arithmetic instruction only performs one operation and always has 3 variables

Design Principle 1: simplicity favors regularity
Design Principle 2: Smaller is faster
Registers are 32 bits

Data transfer instructions

Spilling registers: the proess of putting less frequently used variables into memory

x0 is hardwired to zero

Least significant bit is the right and most is the left
