RISC-V Architecture Notes


All instructions are 32-bits
Types of instructions:
R-Type instructions: register-to-register arithmetic and logical operations. two source registers and one destination register-to-register

I-Type instructions: immediate instructions. uses a 12 bit immediate value with two register operands

S-Type instructions: stores data from a register to memory. two register operands and a 12-bit immediate value for memory address offset

B-Type instructions: conditional branch operations, jumps to a differnet instruction based on a condition. two register operands as a 12-bit immediate value for the branch target address

U-Type instructions: operations with 20-bit immediate values, like loading a constat into a register

J-Type instruction: unconditional jump operations, one register operand and a 20-bit immediate value for the target address

Integer Registers:

32 integer registers that are 32 bits wide
x0: always zero
x1-x32 are general purpose with specific names
x1 (ra) return address register, stores the return address in a function call
x2 (sp) stack pointer register, stores the pointer for position in the stack
x3 (gp) global pointer register, stores the pointer for accessing global data
x4 (tp) thread pointer register,  stores the pointer for thread-local storage
x5-x11 (t0-t6) temporary registers, stores intermediate values during calculations
x10-x17 (a0-a7) argument registers, stores function arguments for passing
x8, x9, x18-x27 (s0-s11) saved registers, preserves values across function calls
x28-x31 (t3-t6) additional temporary registers
